Code samples
============

I would like to take this opportunity to present some **code samples**. Most snippets have been taken from my **Physics Master's thesis**.

My experience involves mostly

* **Python** (learned through online courses, heavy use in university and work/internship projects)
* **C(++)**-(style languages) (learned at university, <a href="https://cppitems.github.io/#/items/alltitle" target="_blank">this website</a> gives a partial overview of the course **Advanced C++ programming**, privately getting started with Arduino programming)
* **Linux commandline/bash** (learned online, use at home, university and work/internships).

In particular I included:

  * **Conv4d.py**: A python implementation of a discrete 4D convolution which can be used as a building block for Convolutional Neural Networks.
  * **nn_pytorch.py**: Part of the code developed for constructing and training neural networks using the pytorch framework with modularity in mind.
  * **asy-directory**: Code regarding a C-style programming language (Asymptote) for creating vector graphics. These images have been published in a journal.
  * **ode_function.zip**: A simple program idea I quickly coded for the purpose of this interview to provide an insight into my programming knowledge. This code is not intended for practical use and I regard it as a short exercise.

I am looking forward to hearing from You and Your team!
